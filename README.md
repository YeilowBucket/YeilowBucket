 ✧ I'm YeilowBucket, but you can just call me Bucket! 

 ✧ This GitHub account is pretty much just for linking my [Strawpage](https://arthurwalton.straw.page/) & [AtaBook](https://yeilowbucket.atabook.org/)!

❗ I have this GitHub attached to all of my PT characters. If it isn't there, it isn't me!  ⚆_⚆
